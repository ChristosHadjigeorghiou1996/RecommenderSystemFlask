# RecommenderSystemFlask

To run my recommendation system, the following libraries are required
numpy==1.16.4
scipy==1.3.1
Flask==1.1.1
pandas==0.24.2
Then, open a terminal in the directory containing these files and type “pip install –user -r requirements.txt” or type pip install for each library in case an error comes up. Subsequently, type “ python app.py” to initialize the server and then launch a browser and connect to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ and finally press “control” and “c” simultaneously on the prompt window to shut down the server.
